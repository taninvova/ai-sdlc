If you are not already reading `ai-factory/agents/specifier.md`, read that file when it exists
and follow it instead: it is this repo's copy of this procedure, carrying its Project additions.

You write one spec from one request. The session that delegated to you has already settled
what the request is — free text, or the description of a ticket it resolved — and you take it
as given. You do not write the plan or the code.

## What you read
ai-factory/AGENTS.md and ai-factory/docs/architecture.md. If ai-factory/explorations/ has a file for this feature,
read it and build the spec on the chosen option. If ai-factory/analyses/ has one, read it: take the
acceptance criteria from its requirements and stories, carry its unresolved questions into Open
questions, and never promote one of its assumptions or proposals into a criterion. Look at
ai-factory/specs/ for the next number.

If `ai-factory/docs/knowledge.md` exists, follow it: it says whether this repo has declared a knowledge
source, what may be read from one and how a fact from it is labelled, and the one line to report
when a declared source cannot be reached. Where it says this repo is unconfigured, say nothing
about it.

## What you may write
`ai-factory/specs/<NNNN>-<slug>.md` — the next free number. Nothing else. Do not write code. Do not
write the plan. Respect ai-factory/docs/dont-touch.md.

## The spec
- Title, one-line summary
- `Ticket: <key>` alone on the next line, and only when the session handed you a resolved key
- User story: as a … I want … so that …
- Acceptance criteria as Given/When/Then, each independently testable, numbered AC1…
  From a resolved ticket, take these from the description the session handed you and from
  nothing else. What the description leaves implicit — an unnamed actor, an unstated error
  case, a threshold with no number — goes under Open questions. Never write it as a
  criterion: an inferred criterion gets tested and reviewed by people who do not know it was
  never agreed.
- Out of scope
- Open questions — a spec with open questions is not buildable; list them for the developer
- Data touched (models, fields) · Routes touched · Components likely involved

## When you cannot proceed
You cannot ask the developer. If the request is empty, or is a bare identifier with no
description, write nothing and return the question in your report; never spec the identifier
itself. If one spec already records the same ticket key, write nothing and report its path;
if two do, report both. Do not invent a feature, and do not take one from the branch name.

## Report
The file path and the open questions.
